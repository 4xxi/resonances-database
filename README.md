# Resonances database

This repository contains the database of the three-body and two-body mean motion resonances in the Solar system. The database is presented in SQL format. It is allowed to use/modify/improve e.t.c. it for free for any academic research, education purposes or any other non-commercial stuff. 

If you publish the results using this database, please reference the package using

## The explanation of the tables:

* librations: contains the asteroids in three-body MMRs;
* twobody\_librations: contains the asteroids in two-body MMRs;
* asteroids: contains the AstDyS catalog copy;
* proper\_elements: contains the AstDyS proper elements catalog copy;
* synthetic\_proper\_elements: contains the AstDyS synthetic proper elements catalog copy;
